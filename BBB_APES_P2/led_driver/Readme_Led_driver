Steps to run the character driver (for successfully running)- 
1. Unbind the existing led driver on Beaglebone green, do this as root - echo leds > /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/device/driver/unbind
2. Refer to the Makefile uploaded(led_driver_makefile), do sudo make all, to compile the LKM for character driver
3. insert the kernel module - insmod ./led_module.ko
4. check the /var/log/syslog file for major number
5. remove any existing char device named /dev/SimplecharDrv by sudo rm /dev/SimplecharDrv
6. use major number in step 4, and run command sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/SimpleCharDrv c <majornumber> 0
7. Now the device has been created so we can begin file operations,
8. run the user application main.c, which also acts as user space code that reads, writes, to the driver by 
gcc user_main.c -o main.o
